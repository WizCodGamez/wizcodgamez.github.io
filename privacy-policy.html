                <h2>SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

                <h2>INFORMATION COLLECTED</h2>
                <hr>

                <h2>Personal Information</h2>
                <hr>

The requested Personal Information may include, but are not limited to: (i) your name, (ii) mailing address, (iii) telephone number, (iv) email address, (v) photo or other image, (vi) credit card information, and (vii) location. Parents or legal guardians providing parental consent (via our Parental Consent Form) may be asked to provide their child's name and email address in addition to information about themselves. You may choose not to provide certain information, but in doing so you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features.

                <h2>Non-Personal Information</h2>
                <hr>
                <br>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Non-Personal Information” means information that does not directly identify you.

A “cookie” is a small bit of record-keeping information that sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people's names, email addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and to “remember” things about the user's visit. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer, although this may affect your ability to shop online and login.

                <h2>III. USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h2>

                <br><br>Names, postal and e-mail addresses and phone numbers collected may be added to our databases and used for future calls and mailings regarding site updates, new products and services, upcoming events and the status of orders placed online.
